            VaultBridge stores only the minimum metadata required to provision share links and audit vault activity. All credential
            payloads stay encrypted at rest and are transmitted via TLS. Shared links inherit their creator's retention policy—when a
            link expires or is revoked, its payload is permanently destroyed.
